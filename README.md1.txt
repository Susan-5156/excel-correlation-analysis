# Correlation Analysis in Excel

## 📊 Project Summary
This project performs correlation analysis on a dataset using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to explore relationships between variables through visual charts and correlation coefficients.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- CORREL function
- Scatter plots
- Conditional formatting

## 📁 Files
- `Correlation_Analysis.xlsx` – Main Excel file with analysis
- `images/` – (Optional) Screenshots or visual output

## 📁 Dataset
This project uses a **simulated dataset** generated with fake for demonstration purposes. It includes same columns as the original dataset but with fake data and is safe to share publicly.

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Identified pairwise correlations between variables
- Visualized data trends using scatter plots
- Explored significance of correlations

## 🔗 Notes
This is an academic project using sample data. Feel free to reuse or build on it.
